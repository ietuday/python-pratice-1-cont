<p>In the previous videos I covered how to interact with PostGreSQL databases. In case you prefer to work with MySQL databases instead, please see the code further below.</p><p>I set up a remote MySQL database on a server with IP address 108.167.140.122, so you don't have to install and set up a MySQL database yourself. To connect and query data from that remote database, you need a <em>username</em>, <em>password</em>, and the name of the <em>database</em>. These are written inside the Python script below.</p><p>You also need a Python library that interacts with MySQL databases. There are many, but I prefer <em>mysql.connector</em>. To install it, simply execute <code><strong>pip install mysql-connector</strong></code>  or <code><strong>pip3 install mysql-connector</strong></code> depending on whether you use <em>pip</em> or <em>pip3</em>. Once you install the library you can go ahead and try this working example:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">import mysql.connector
word = input("Enter a word in English and press Enter: ")
con = mysql.connector.connect(
    user="ardit700_student", 
    password = "ardit700_student", 
    host="108.167.140.122", 
    database = "ardit700_pm1database"
)
cursor = con.cursor()
query = cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM Dictionary WHERE Expression = '%s'" % word)
results = cursor.fetchall()
if results:
    for result in results:
        print(result[1])
else:
    print("We couldn't find any results about that.")</pre>
