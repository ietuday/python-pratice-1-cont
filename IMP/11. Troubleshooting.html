<p>If you deployed your website on Heroku but you get an Application Error when you visit the website on the browser, then you probably did something wrong during the deployment.</p><p>No worries, you can see what you did wrong by looking at the server logs. You can do that by running the following in your terminal:</p><p><code>heroku logs</code></p><p>That will show a series of messages. Try to read them carefully to understand what has gone wrong. In case you have troubles understanding the logs, feel free to post them in the Q&amp;A.</p>
